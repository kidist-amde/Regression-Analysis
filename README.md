# Regression-Analysis

- Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows you to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest.(The estimation of relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables) It  used to identify the line or curve which provides the best fit through a set of data points. This curve can be useful to identify a trend in the data, whether it is linear, parabolic, or of some other form.
- In addition to fitting a curve to given data, regression analysis can be used in combination with statistical techniques to determine the validity of data points within a data set.

- Types of regression analysis

    1. Simple Linear Regression : a model that assesses the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable

    2. Multiple Linear Regression: a model with multiple independent variables.

    3. Non Linear Regression : Mainly used for more complicated data sets in which the dependent and independent variables show a nonlinear relationship.
